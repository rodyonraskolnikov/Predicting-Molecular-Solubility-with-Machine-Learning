# **Predicting Molecular Solubility with Machine Learning**

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning regression models using molecular descriptor data to predict aqueous solubility (`logS`) of chemical compounds.

## üîç Objective

The goal of this project is to develop and compare machine learning models to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. Using a publicly available dataset from [Delaney Solubility Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/refs/heads/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv)
, I explored how chemical structure information can be used to model solubility behavior‚Äîa key property in drug design and materials science.

By applying both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, I assessed the performance of each model and interpreted their ability to generalize to unseen molecular data. This project showcases end-to-end ML workflows including:

- Data loading and cleaning

- Feature/target separation

- Model training and prediction

- Evaluation using MSE and R¬≤ Score

- Model comparison for insight into performance tradeoffs

## üìÅ Dataset

- Source: [Delaney solubility dataset](https://github.com/dataprofessor/data/blob/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv)
- Target variable: `logS` (log-scale solubility)
- Features: Molecular descriptors derived from chemical structure

## üß™ Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression** (with `max_depth=2`)

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R¬≤ Score (Training and Test)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üßæ Results Summary

| Model              | Training MSE | Training R¬≤ | Test MSE | Test R¬≤ |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression | *calculated* | *calculated*| *calc.*  | *calc.* |
| Random Forest     | *calculated* | *calculated*| *calc.*  | *calc.* |

> Replace *calculated* with actual results from the notebook when finalized.
